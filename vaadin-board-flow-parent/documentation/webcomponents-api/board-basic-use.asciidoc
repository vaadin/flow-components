[[board.basic-use.configuration]]
== Basic Configuration

[classname]#vaadin-board# is divided into rows, using [classname]#vaadin-board-row#.
Rows are divided into columns.
You can put any WebComponent or HTML element inside the [classname]#vaadin-board-row#.
Every element inside the row can take from one to four columns.
Based on available space, the vaadin board rearranges child elements based on available space.
In the example below every child [elementname]#div# will use 33% on Desktop, but will be
rearranged to two rows when switching to tablet: one row with 2 items 50% of available space each and second row
with 100% width item, see example below.

[[board.basic-use.styling]]
== Styling

Vaadin Board rearranges elements in your layout based on available space.
In some cases you want to use different styles depending on how the elements are laid out, e.g. use smaller font size for mobile devices.

* small - for rows smaller than 600 pixels.
* middle - for rows between 600 and 969 pixels.
* large - for rows bigger than 960 pixels.

      <div>top C</div>
  </vaadin-board-row>
</vaadin-board>

    font-size:20px;
}

[[board.basic-use.redraw]]
=== Redraw method

Vaadin Board relies on resize events to achieve responsiveness.
In some cases the board size might change without a resize event, for instance if a fixed size is set in its style, for such cases the [methodname]#redraw# method of the [elementname]#vaadin-board# element should be used.

# Vaadin Flow Components

This is a maven multi-module project including all vaadin flow components.

`master` branch is the latest version of all the components that will be released in the [Vaadin platform](https://github.com/vaadin/platform).

## Compiling all the components and their modules including ITs

- `mvn clean compile -DskipTests -T C2`

## Compiling all modules but excluding ITs

- `mvn clean compile -DskipTests -Drelease -T C2`

## Installing all modules

- `mvn clean install -DskipTests -Drelease -T C2`

## Running one component demo

- `mvn -am -pl vaadin-checkbox-flow-parent/vaadin-checkbox-flow-demo -Pwar jetty:run`

Then navigate to `http://localhost:9998/vaadin-checkbox` to see the demo.

## Running the ITs of one component

- `mvn -am -pl vaadin-checkbox-flow-parent/vaadin-checkbox-flow-integration-tests verify`

## Running ITs of all components

NOTE: this takes a long while and consumes a lot of resources in your computer

- `mvn clean verify -T C2`

## Merging ITs of all components in one module

There is a able to visit all IT modules and merge then into one unique module.
It does substitutions in sources so as routes do no conflict, and also adjust ports etc.

- `./scripts/mergeITs.js`

By default it merges all modules, but it's also possible to merge certain modules by passing arguments

- `./scripts/mergeITs.js button text-field crud`

## Updating modules from original master branches

By running `./scripts/updateFromMaster.sh` all components are replaced with their origin master branches.
It also aligns component poms and folder naming.

## Build script

The `./build.sh` script is though to be run in CI, it compiles all modules, merge IT's and run those.
It expects `TBLICENSE` and `TBHUB` variables when run in the CI server.
Optionally it's possible to run just a bunch of modules e.g. `./build.sh grid combo-box`

## Update Webjars
There is script available for updating the webjars version used in the projects. This can be triggered by running:
- `./scripts/updateWebjars.js`

## Using the component in a Flow application

add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-checkbox-flow</artifactId>

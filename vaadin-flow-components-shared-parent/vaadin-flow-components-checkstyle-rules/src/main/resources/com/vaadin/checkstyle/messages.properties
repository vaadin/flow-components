ui.setcurrent.no.field=UI.setCurrent() argument ''{0}'' is not a class field. The UI is held internally via WeakReference and may be garbage collected, causing UI.getCurrent() to return null. Store the UI in a class field to prevent this.
ui.setcurrent.static.method=UI.setCurrent() must not be called from a static method because CurrentInstanceCleanerListener from flow-test-generic resets the current UI before each test. Move this call to an instance method or @Before/@BeforeEach setup method.

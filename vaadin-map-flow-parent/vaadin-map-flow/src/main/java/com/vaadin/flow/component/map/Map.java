/**
 * Map is a component for displaying geographic maps from various sources. It
 * supports multiple layers, tiled and full image sources, adding markers, and
 * interaction through events.
 * <p>
 * Each map consists of one or more {@link Layer}s that display geographical
 * data. Each layer has a {@link Source} that provides that data. The Map
 * component provides several types of layers (for example {@link TileLayer},
 * {@link VectorLayer}, {@link ImageLayer}), as well as several types of sources
 * that can be used with each type of layer (for example {@link OSMSource},
 * {@link XYZSource}, {@link VectorSource}).
 * <p>
 * The map component comes pre-configured with a background layer, which by
 * default is a {@link TileLayer} using an {@link OSMSource}, which means that
 * it displays tiled image data from the OpenStreeMap service. The background
 * layer of the map can be replaced using {@link #setBackgroundLayer(Layer)}.
 * The component is also pre-configured with a {@link FeatureLayer}, accessible
 * with {@link #getFeatureLayer()}, that allows to quickly display geographical
 * features, such as markers (see {@link MarkerFeature}), on top of a map.
 * Custom layers can be added or removed using {@link #addLayer(Layer)} and
 * {@link #removeLayer(Layer)}.
 * <p>
 * The viewport of the map is controlled through a {@link View}, which allows
 * setting the center, zoom level and rotation. The map's view can be accessed
 * through {@link Map#getView()}.
 * <p>
 * The default projection, or coordinate system, for all coordinates passed to,
 * or returned from the public API is {@code EPSG:4326}, also referred to as GPS
 * coordinates. This is called the user projection. Internally the component
 * converts all coordinates into the projection that is used by the map's
 * {@link View}, which is referred to as the view projection. The user
 * projection can be changed using {@link #setUserProjection(String)}. Out of
 * the box, the map component has support for the {@code EPSG:4326} and
 * {@code EPSG:3857} projections. Custom coordinate projections can be defined
 * using {@link #defineProjection(String, String)}.

/**
 * Base class for all map configuration objects that represent an OL class. The
 * class provides functionality to support the synchronization mechanism between
 * server and client, such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>generates a unique ID for each object, using {@link UUID}</li>
 * <li>implements change tracking / dirty checking using {@link #markAsDirty()}
 * and {@link #collectChanges(Consumer)}</li>
 * <li>implements the observable pattern using {@link PropertyChangeSupport}, in
 * order to notify the map component about changes to the configuration, see
 * {@link #notifyChange()}</li>
 * <li>keeps track of, and notifies about changes to nested configuration
 * objects, see {@link #addChild(AbstractConfigurationObject)} and
 * {@link #removeChild(AbstractConfigurationObject)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When adding new API to the Map component using this class, there are several
 * rules to follow:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implement {@link #getType()} to return a unique type name. This type name
 * is used by the client-side synchronization to determine which OpenLayers
 * class to instantiate for objects of this type. See
 * {@code META-INF/resources/frontend/vaadin-map/synchronization/index.js} for
 * how the synchronization resolves type names.</li>
 * <li>Every setter must call {@link #markAsDirty()} in order to mark this
 * object as changed, and to trigger a change event to schedule a sync. of this
 * change. See {@link View#setCenter(Coordinate)} for an example.</li>
 * <li>Setters for nested objects must keep track of nested references using
 * {@link #addChild(AbstractConfigurationObject)} and
 * {@link #removeChild(AbstractConfigurationObject)}. See
 * {@link Configuration#setView(View)} for an example.</li>
 * <li>When using collection properties, do not expose the collection directly
 * for manipulation, as manipulating the collection does not mark the object as
 * changed, and does not trigger a change event. Instead add methods for
 * manipulating the collection, and keep track of objects being added / removed
 * from the collection using {@link #addChild(AbstractConfigurationObject)} and
 * {@link #removeChild(AbstractConfigurationObject)}. See
 * {@link Configuration#addLayer(Layer)} and
 * {@link Configuration#removeLayer(Layer)} for an example.</li>
 * <li>For properties that contain nested configuration objects, or collections,
 * use the Jackson {@link JsonIdentityInfo} and {@link JsonIdentityReference}
 * annotations to only serialize the ID of the object. See
 * {@link Configuration#getLayers()} for an example.</li>
 * <li>For properties that are not needed on the client-side, or do not have a
 * pendant in the OpenLayers API, use the Jackson {@link JsonIgnore} annotation
 * to reduce the JSON payload that is sent to the client on each
 * synchronization, and to prevent possible errors by passing unrecognized
 * options to the OpenLayers API. See {@link View#getExtent()} for an
 * example.</li>
 * <li>Not every class used in configuring the map necessarily needs to extend
 * from {@link AbstractConfigurationObject}. Using this class is only necessary
 * if an object is supposed to be modified by the developer (e.g. a Layer should
 * be modifiable to change its visibility). If the object is small, or can be
 * immutable, it might make sense to not extend from this class, and instead
 * force the developer to create new instances instead. See {@link Coordinate}
 * for an example, where making coordinates modifiable / synchronizable would
 * just add more overhead, and where it's reasonable to just create new
 * instances instead.</li>
 * </ul>

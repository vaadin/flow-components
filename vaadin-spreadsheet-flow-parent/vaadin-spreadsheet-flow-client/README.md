For building it you just need to run `mvn package` and the result JS will be installed in the resources folder of the `vaadin-spreadsheet-flow` component.

### License

This module is not delivered as an artifact, though, the output of this module (the JS resulting of the compilation), is deliver under the `vaadin-spreadsheet-flow` artifact under the CVDLv4. 

This module depends on the Vaadin Framework v8, but it's used only during the compilation performed to deliver the product. Thus any license term in Vaadin Framework 8.0 it's not propagated to customers using the Vaadin Spreadsheet for Flow.

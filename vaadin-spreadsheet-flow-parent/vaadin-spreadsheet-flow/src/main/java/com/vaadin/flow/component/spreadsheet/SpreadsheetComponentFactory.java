/**
 * Defines an interface for having custom components inside the
 * {@link Spreadsheet}. Use it with
 * {@link Spreadsheet#setSpreadsheetComponentFactory(SpreadsheetComponentFactory)}
 * . The more custom components you have visible, the slower the spreadsheet
 * comes. It is a very bad idea to have layouts and complex widgets inside the
 * spreadsheet.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of custom components inside the {@link Cell}s. The ones
 * returned by
 * {@link #getCustomComponentForCell(Cell, int, int, Spreadsheet, Sheet)} are
 * always visible inside the cells as they are rendered. These components are
 * unique per cell. Having many of them visible at the same time will decrease
 * the spreadsheet performance. This method is <b>NOT</b> meant for displaying
 * images or charts inside the spreadsheet.
 * <p>
 * The components returned by
 * {@link #getCustomEditorForCell(Cell, int, int, Spreadsheet, Sheet)} are shown
 * as the cells are selected. Thus, they are meant for replacing the default
 * inline editor in the spreadsheet. These components can be shared with
 * multiple cells; when a component comes visible inside a cell, the
 * {@link #onCustomEditorDisplayed(Cell, int, int, Spreadsheet, Sheet, com.vaadin.flow.component.Component)}
 * is called with the appropriate parameters making it possible to update custom
 * editor value to correspond to the cell's value.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getCustomComponentForCell(Cell, int, int, Spreadsheet, Sheet)} is
 * called first

/**
 * Possible values: null, ON, BETWEEN.
 * 
 * In a column chart, when pointPlacement is ON, the point will not create any
 * padding of the X-axis. In a polar column chart this means that the first
 * column points directly north. If the pointPlacement is BETWEEN, the columns
 * will be laid out between ticks. This is useful for example for visualizing an
 * amount between two points in time or in a certain sector of a polar chart.
 * 
 * Defaults to null in Cartesian charts, BETWEEN in polar charts.

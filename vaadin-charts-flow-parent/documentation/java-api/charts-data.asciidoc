[[charts.data]]
= Chart Data

Chart data is stored in a data series model that contains information about the
visual representation of the data points in addition to their values. There are
a number of different types of series - [classname]#DataSeries#,
[classname]#ListSeries#, [classname]#HeatSeries#, and
[classname]#RangeSeries#.

[[charts.data.listseries]]
== List Series

The [classname]#ListSeries# is essentially a helper type that makes the handling
of simple sequential data easier than with [classname]#DataSeries#. The data
points are assumed to be at a constant interval on the X axis, starting from the
value specified with the [literal]#++pointStart++# property (default is 0) at
intervals specified with the [literal]#++pointInterval++# property (default is
1.0). The two properties are defined in the [classname]#PlotOptions# for the
series.

The Y axis values are given as constructor parameters or using the  [methodname]#setData()# method.

[source, java]
----
ListSeries series = new ListSeries(
      "Total Reindeer Population",
      181091, 201485, 188105);
PlotOptionsLine plotOptions = new PlotOptionsLine();
plotOptions.setPointStart(1959);
series.setPlotOptions(plotOptions);
conf.addSeries(series);
----

You can also add them one by one with the [methodname]#addData()# method.

If the chart has multiple Y axes, you can specify the axis for the series by its
index number using [methodname]#setyAxis()#.


[[charts.data.dataseries]]
== Generic Data Series

The [classname]#DataSeries# can represent a sequence of data points at an
interval as well as scatter data. Data points are represented with the
[classname]#DataSeriesItem# class, which has [parameter]#x# and [parameter]#y#
properties for representing the data value. Each item can be given a category
name.

[source, java]
----
DataSeries series = new DataSeries();
series.setName("Total Reindeer Population");
series.add(new DataSeriesItem(1959, 181091));
series.add(new DataSeriesItem(1960, 201485));
series.add(new DataSeriesItem(1961, 188105));
series.add(new DataSeriesItem(1962, 177206));

// Modify the radius of one point
series.get(2).getMarker().setRadius(20);
conf.addSeries(series);
----

Data points are associated with some visual representation parameters: marker
style, selected state, legend index, and dial style (for gauges). Most of them
can be configured at the level of individual data series items, the series, or
in the overall plot options for the chart. The configuration options are
described in
<<dummy/../../../charts/java-api/charts-configuration#charts.configuration,"Chart
Configuration">>. Some parameters, such as the sliced option for pie charts is
only meaningful to configure at item level.

[[charts.data.dataseries.add]]
=== Adding and Removing Data Items

New [classname]#DataSeriesItem# items are added to a series with the
[methodname]#add()# method. The basic method takes just the data item, but the
other method takes also two boolean parameters. If the [parameter]#updateChart#
parameter is [literal]#++false++#, the chart is not updated immediately. This is
useful if you are adding many points in the same request.

The [parameter]#shift# parameter, when [literal]#++true++#, causes removal of
the first data point in the series in an optimized manner, thereby allowing an
animated chart that moves to left as new points are added. This is most
meaningful with data with even intervals.

You can remove data points with the [methodname]#remove()# method in the series.
Removal is generally not animated, unless a data point is added in the same
change, as is caused by the [parameter]#shift# parameter for the
[methodname]#add()#.


[[charts.data.dataseries.update]]
=== Updating Data Items

If you update the properties of a [classname]#DataSeriesItem# object, you need
to call the [methodname]#update()# method for the series with the item as the
parameter. Changing data in this way causes animation
of the change.


[[charts.data.dataseries.range]]
=== Range Data

Range charts expect the Y values to be specified as minimum-maximum value pairs.
The [classname]#DataSeriesItem# provides [methodname]#setLow()# and
[methodname]#setHigh()# methods to set the minimum and maximum values of a data
point, as well as a number of constructors that accept the values.

[source, java]
----
RangeSeries series =
    new RangeSeries("Temperature Extremes");

// Give low-high values in constructor
series.add(new DataSeriesItem(0, -51.5, 10.9));
series.add(new DataSeriesItem(1, -49.0, 11.8));

// Set low-high values with setters
DataSeriesItem point = new DataSeriesItem();
point.setX(2);
point.setLow(-44.3);
point.setHigh(17.5);
series.add(point);
----

The [classname]#RangeSeries# offers a slightly simplified way of adding ranged
data points, as described in <<charts.data.rangeseries>>.

[[charts.data.rangeseries]]
== Range Series

The [classname]#RangeSeries# is a helper class that extends
[classname]#DataSeries# to allow specifying interval data a bit easier, with a
list of minimum-maximum value ranges in the Y axis. You can use the series in
range charts, as described in
<<dummy/../../../charts/java-api/charts-charttypes#charts.charttypes.rangecharts,"Area and
Column Range Charts">>.

For the X axis, the coordinates are generated at fixed intervals starting from the
value specified with the [literal]#++pointStart++# property (default is 0) at
intervals specified with the [literal]#++pointInterval++# property (default is
1.0).

[[charts.data.rangeseries.data]]
=== Setting the Data

The data in a [classname]#RangeSeries# is given as an array of minimum-maximum
value pairs for the Y value axis. The pairs are also represented as arrays. You
can pass the data using the ellipsis in the constructor or using
[methodname]#setData()#:

[source, java]
----
RangeSeries series =
    new RangeSeries("Temperature Ranges",
    new Double[]{-51.5,10.9},
    new Double[]{-49.0,11.8},
    ...
    new Double[]{-47.0,10.8});
conf.addSeries(series);
----

[[charts.data.dataproviderseries]]
== Data Provider Series

[classname]#DataProviderSeries# is an adapter for using a Vaadin [interfacename]#DataProvider# as a [classname]#DataSeries# in a chart. Using [methodname]#setPointName()#, [methodname]#setX()#, and [methodname]#setY()# you can define which parts of the bean in the [interfacename]#DataProvider# are used in the chart.

[NOTE]
[classname]#DataProviderSeries# is based on the data model in Vaadin Framework 8.
It replaces [classname]#ContainerDataSeries#, which allowed binding to a [interfacename]#Container# data model in Vaadin Framework 7.

Let us consider an example, where we have a [interfacename]#DataProvider# which provides items of type [classname]#Order#.
The [classname]#Order# class has `getDescription()`, `getUnitPrice()`, and `getQuantity()` to be used for the chart:

[source, java]
----
public class Order {
    private String description;
    private int quantity;
    private double unitPrice;

    public Order(String description, int quantity, double unitPrice) {
        this.description = description;
        this.quantity = quantity;
        this.unitPrice = unitPrice;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    public double getUnitPrice() {
        return unitPrice;
    }

    public double getTotalPrice() {
        return unitPrice * quantity;
    }
}
----

If we have a data provider containing a list of [classname]#Order# instances:

[source, java]
----
// The data
List<Order> orders = new ArrayList<>();
orders.add(new Order("Domain Name", 3, 7.99));
orders.add(new Order("SSL Certificate", 1, 119.00));
orders.add(new Order("Web Hosting", 1, 19.95));
orders.add(new Order("Email Box", 20, 0.15));
orders.add(new Order("E-Commerce Setup", 1, 25.00));
orders.add(new Order("Technical Support", 1, 50.00));

DataProvider<Order, ?> dataProvider = new ListDataProvider<>(orders);
----

We can display the data in a [classname]#Chart# as follows:

[source, java]
----
// Create a chart and use the data provider
Chart chart = new Chart(ChartType.COLUMN);
Configuration configuration = chart.getConfiguration();
DataProviderSeries<Order> series = new DataProviderSeries<>(dataProvider, Order::getTotalPrice);
configuration.addSeries(series);
----

[NOTE]
The [classname]#DataProviderSeries# constructor takes the `y` value provider as an optional argument. It can also be set using [methodname]#setY#.

To make the chart look nicer, we can add a name for the series and show the order description when hovering points:
[source, java]
----
series.setName("Order item quantities");
series.setX(Order::getDescription);
----

To show the description also as x axis labels, we need to set the x axis type to category as the labels are strings:
[source, java]
----
configuration.getxAxis().setType(AxisType.CATEGORY);
----

The result, with some added titles, is shown in <<figure.charts.data.containerseries>>.

[NOTE]
Dynamic changes to the data will be loaded in the data series after calling the [methodname]#refreshAll()# method in the [classname]#DataProvider#.
This behavior can be disabled by setting the [propertyname]#automaticChartUpdateEnabled# property to [literal]#false# in [classname]#DataProviderSeries#.

[[charts.data.drilldown]]
== Drill-Down

Vaadin Charts allows drilling down from a chart to a more detailed view by
clicking an item in the top-level view. To enable the feature, you need to
provide a separate data series for each of the detailed views by calling the
[methodname]#addItemWithDrilldown()# method. When the user clicks on a
drill-down item, the current series is animated into the the linked drill-down
series. A customizable back button is provided to navigate back to the main
series, as shown in <<figure.charts.data.drilldown.drilldown-details>>.

[[figure.charts.data.drilldown.drilldown-details]]
.Detailed series after a drill-down
image::img/charts-drilldown-details.png[]

To make use of drill-down, you need to provide the top-level series and all the
series below it beforehand. The data is transferred to the client-side at the
same time and no client-server communication needs to happen for the drill-down.
The drill-down series must have an identifier, set with [methodname]#setId()#,
as shown below.

[source, java]
----
DataSeries series = new DataSeries();

DataSeriesItem mainItem = new DataSeriesItem("MSIE", 55.11);

DataSeries drillDownSeries = new DataSeries("MSIE versions");
drillDownSeries.setId("MSIE");

drillDownSeries.add(new DataSeriesItem("MSIE 6.0", 10.85));
drillDownSeries.add(new DataSeriesItem("MSIE 7.0", 7.35));
drillDownSeries.add(new DataSeriesItem("MSIE 8.0", 33.06));
drillDownSeries.add(new DataSeriesItem("MSIE 9.0", 2.81));

series.addItemWithDrilldown(mainItem, drillDownSeries);
